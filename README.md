# tools

Tools used to check the data quality and extract specific data from the databases.
Tools are provided in the form of Jupyter Notebook that can be run online on the Binder platform.

Tools:
- To check the data quality of the template: [data check](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carboseq/tools/main?urlpath=voila/render/notebooks/data-check.ipynb)
- To filter and extract the data from the database: [data extraction](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carboseq/tools/main?urlpath=voila/render/notebooks/data-query.ipynb)
- Common errors: [link](https://carboseq.github.io/tools/errors.html)
- [Map of the experiment in the database](https://carboseq.github.io/tools/map.html)

Note that the binder may take a bit of time to load if the repository has been updated recently (it needs to rebuild a docker image).
